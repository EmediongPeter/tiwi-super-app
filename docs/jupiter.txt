## Features

<Callout icon="book-open" color="#FFC107" iconType="regular">[Read our latest blog on Ultra V3](/blog/ultra-v3).</Callout>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Juno Liquidity Engine">
    Ultra Swap utilizes the latest [Juno Liquidity Engine](/docs/routing) which aggregates across multiple liquidity sources, including Jupiter's proprietary routing engines: improved versions of Iris and JupiterZ, and third-party liquidity sources, for the best possible price.

    It also includes self-learning capabilities (to detect and sideline low-quality liquidity sources) which creates a competitive environment for all liquidity sources to continously optimize their performance and price.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Best Executed Price">
    Ultra Swap guarantees the best executed price through several key innovations:

    * **Predictive Execution**: Ultra simulates and compares executed prices (not just quoted prices) before actually sending a transaction, dynamically selecting the route with the least slippage for real user outcomes.
    * **Ultra Signaling**: Ultra provides signaling to Proprietary AMMs to help them distinguish Ultra user flow, incentivizing them to quote tighter spreads and better prices.
    * **Slippage-Aware Routing**: Automatically prioritizes and selects routes that minimize realized slippage, protecting users from misleading "best quotes" that deliver poor executed results.

    For detailed examples and results, see [our Ultra V3 blog post](/blog/ultra-v3#maximising-executed-price).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sub-second Transaction Landing & MEV Protection">
    Ultra is now using our new in-house transaction-landing engine, Jupiter Beam, which allows us to send transactions via our own infrastructure: designed to make every trade faster, more private, and more precise.

    * Leverage our own validator stake and dedicated R\&D efforts.
    * Complete transaction privacy until on-chain execution.
    * Eliminate the risk of artificial delays and front-running, ensuring faster and more secure execution for our users.

    Results:

    * Landing Latency: Improved by 50-66% compared to our previous approach that relied on multiple providers
      * Lands in 0–1 block (\~50–400ms)
      * Compared to the 1–3 blocks (\~400ms–1.2s) previously.
    * MEV Protection: Routing transactions through our own infrastructure provides:
      * Complete transaction privacy until on-chain execution.
      * Reduce frontrunning exposure - transactions are invisible to public mempool scanners.
      * Reduce risk of sandwich attack vectors - [see our blog post on Ultra's swap volume to value extracted ratio](/blog/ultra-v3#mev-protection).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Real Time Slippage Estimator">
    Building on top of our previous versions of slippage estimation/optimization engines, we have developed a new Real Time Slippage Estimator (RTSE), that is able to intelligently estimate the best possible slippage to use at the time of execution, balancing between trade success and price protection.

    RTSE uses a variety of heuristics, algorithms and monitoring to ensure the best user experience:

    * Heuristics: Token categories, historical and real-time slippage data, and more.
      * Uses token categories to intelligently estimate slippage for different token types.
      * Automatic prioritization of slippage-protected routes over purely price-optimized routes.
      * Increased volatility sensitivity for tokens with high historical volatility patterns.
    * Algorithms: Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on slippage data, and more.
    * Monitoring: Real-time monitoring of failure rates to ensure reactiveness to increase slippage when necessary.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Gasless">
    Ultra Swap provides different gasless mechanisms for different scenarios.

    * Gasless via Jupiter Z (RFQ): All swaps routed via Jupiter Z are gasless, as the market maker is the fee payer for the transaction.
    * Gasless via Gasless Support: Depending on the tokens and trade sizes of your swap, Ultra Swap will automatically determine if it can provide gasless support to your swap by helping you pay for the transaction fee of your swap - you can identify this via the secondary signer in the transaction.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="API Latency">
    95% of all swaps are executed under 2 seconds via our proprietary transaction sending engine.

## What About Metis Swap API?

Ultra Swap API is the next evolution of our swap infrastructure, designed and continuously optimized to deliver the best possible trading experience on Solana. We are focused on providing a high-performance, reliable, and feature-rich API that incorporates the latest advancements and optimizations for users and integrators.

While Ultra Swap API is engineered for optimal performance and ease of integration, the Metis Swap API remains available for developers who require advanced customization, such as:

* Adding custom instructions.
* Incorporating Cross Program Invocation (CPI) calls.
* Selecting specific broadcasting strategies for signed transactions (e.g., priority fee, Jito, etc.).
* Choosing which DEXes or AMMs to route through.
* Modifying the number of accounts used in a transaction.

If your use case demands these highly custom features, the Metis Swap API may be more suitable. However, it also requires you to manage many aspects that Ultra Swap API handles automatically, including:

* **RPC management**: Retrieving wallet balances, broadcasting, and tracking transactions.
* **Transaction fee selection**: Managing priority fees, Jito fees, and more.
* **Slippage optimization**: Determining the best slippage settings for trade success and price protection.
* **Transaction broadcasting**: Ultra Swap leverages a proprietary transaction engine for superior speed and reliability.
* **Swap result parsing**: Handling transaction polling, parsing, and error management.

For most developers and applications, Ultra Swap API is the recommended choice, as it is purpose-built and continually improved to provide the best possible swap experience on Solana.

Here's what I found from their docs
# Get Order

> Swap via Ultra by getting a quote from the Order endpoint.

To get an Ultra Swap order, you need to pass in the required parameters such as:

| Parameter         | Description                                                                                                                             |
| :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `inputMint`       | The input token mint address                                                                                                            |

| `amount`          | The amount of input token to swap, in native token units (before decimals)                                                              |
| `taker`           | The user's wallet address (**Note:** If the `taker` is not provided, there will still be an Order Response with no `transaction` field) |
| `referralAccount` | The referral account address - refer to the [Add Fees To Ultra Swap](/docs/ultra/add-fees-to-ultra) guide for the step by step process  |
| `referralFee`     | The referral fee in basis points (bps)                                                                                                  |

```js Get Order theme={null}
const orderResponse = await (
  await fetch(
    'https://api.jup.ag/ultra/v1/order' +
    '?inputMint=So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112' +
    '&outputMint=EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v' +
    '&amount=100000000' +
    '&taker=jdocuPgEAjMfihABsPgKEvYtsmMzjUHeq9LX4Hvs7f3',
    {
      headers: {
        'x-api-key': 'your-api-key',
      },
    }
  )
).json();
```

## Order Response

In the order response, you will receive a number of fields that are important to note of, such as the `swapType`, `slippageBps`, etc.

<Note>
  Refer to [Response](/docs/ultra/response) section for example responses.
  Refer to [API Reference](/api-reference/ultra) section for the full response fields.
</Note>

The main fields you should need:

* `transaction`: The base64 encoded transaction that you need to sign before submitting to the network.
* `requestId`: The request ID of the order to be used in the `Execute Order` endpoint.

Now, you are able to get a swap order, next steps is to make a post request to the `Execute Order` endpoint. [Let's go](/docs/ultra/execute-order)!

# Execute Order

> Swap via Ultra by signing then submitting the transaction to the Execute endpoint .

## Sign Transaction

Using the Solana `web3.js@1` library, you can sign the transaction as follows:

<Accordion title="Set up dependencies and wallet for signing">
  **Set up dependencies for signing**

  ```bash  theme={null}
  npm install @solana/web3.js@1
  ```

  **Set up Development Wallet**

  <Info>
    You can paste in your private key for testing but this is not recommended for production.

    * Either use your private key in the project directly, you can do it via a `.env` file.
    * Or set up your private key in the [Solana CLI](https://solana.com/docs/intro/installation#create-wallet).
  </Info>

  <CodeGroup>
    ```javascript Store private key in .env theme={null}
    // In your .env file
    PRIVATE_KEY=""

    // In your index.js (or any file that needs the private key)
    import { Keypair } from '@solana/web3.js';
    import dotenv from 'dotenv';
    require('dotenv').config();

    const wallet = Keypair.fromSecretKey(bs58.decode(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY || '')));
    ```

    ```javascript Store private key in Solana CLI theme={null}
    import { Keypair } from '@solana/web3.js';
    import fs from 'fs';

    const privateKeyArray = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('/Path/to/.config/solana/id.json', 'utf8').trim());
    const wallet = Keypair.fromSecretKey(new Uint8Array(privateKeyArray));
    ```
  </CodeGroup>
</Accordion>

```js Sign Transaction theme={null}
import { VersionedTransaction } from '@solana/web3.js';

// ... Get Order's response

// Extract the transaction from the order response
const transactionBase64 = orderResponse.transaction

// Deserialize, sign and serialize the transaction
const transaction = VersionedTransaction.deserialize(Buffer.from(transactionBase64, 'base64'));
transaction.sign([wallet]);
const signedTransaction = Buffer.from(transaction.serialize()).toString('base64');
```

## Execute Order

By making a post request to the `/execute` endpoint, Jupiter executes the swap transaction on behalf of you/your users through our own proprietary transaction sending infrastructure. This already includes handling of slippage, priority fees, transaction landing and more.

To make a post request to execute a swap order, you need to pass in the required parameters,:

* `signedTransaction`: The signed and serialized base64 encodedtransaction [like above](#sign-transaction)
* `requestId`: The order response's request ID [from Get Order](/docs/ultra/get-order)

```js Execute Order theme={null}
const executeResponse = await (
    await fetch('https://api.jup.ag/ultra/v1/execute', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'x-api-key': 'your-api-key',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            signedTransaction: signedTransaction,
            requestId: orderResponse.requestId,
        }),
    })
).json();
```

## Transaction Status Polling

After our transaction sending service has submitted your swap, we will actively poll for your transaction status as part of the `/execute` endpoint. You will receive a response with the status of the swap.

<Tip>
  * You can submit with the same `signedTransaction` and `requestId` for **up to 2 minutes regardless of state**, to poll for the transaction status.
  * The transaction will not double execute since it has the same signature.
  * If connection got dropped, you can try again with the same `signedTransaction` and `requestId` to poll for the status of the swap.
  * If there is no status, the order likely expired (did not get processed onchain and failed), but reach out to us if cases like this happen.
</Tip>

```js Transaction Status Polling theme={null}
if (executeResponse.status === "Success") {
    console.log('Swap successful:', JSON.stringify(executeResponse, null, 2));
    console.log(`https://solscan.io/tx/${executeResponse.signature}`);
} else {
    console.error('Swap failed:', JSON.stringify(executeResponse, null, 2));
    console.log(`https://solscan.io/tx/${executeResponse.signature}`);
}
```

# Search Token

The Ultra Swap API provides an endpoint to search tokens in the background for you and returns you the search results, along with the mint information.

This is useful in most user applications, as users need to choose which tokens they want to swap. This also provides a seamless developer experience as integrating this allows us to handle and abstract the token search mechanism, allowing you to focus on other user features.

<Info>
  **SEARCH**

  * Search for a token and its information by its **symbol, name or mint address**.
  * Comma-separate to search for multiple.
  * Limit to 100 mint addresses in query.
  * Default to 20 mints in response when searching via symbol or name.
</Info>

```js  theme={null}
const searchResponse = await (
  await fetch(`https://api.jup.ag/ultra/v1/search?query=So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112`,
    {
      headers: {
        'x-api-key': 'your-api-key',
      },
    }
  )
).json();
```

## Search Response

The search response will return an array of mints, along with their information.

<Tip>
  **USEFUL MINT INFORMATION**

  * Token Metadata like name, symbol, icon to display token information to users
  * [Organic Score](/docs/tokens/organic-score), Holder count, Market cap, etc can be useful to help make a better trading decision
  * And much more!

  Do note that the response is subject to changes as we continue to improve.

  Refer to [Ultra Swap API Reference](/api-reference/ultra/search) for full schema.

| **Base URL**            | `https://api.jup.ag/ultra/`                  |
| **Cost**                | Free to use, but Ultra Swap incurs swap fees |
| **API Key**             | Required                                     |
| **Requests Per Minute** | Base Quota + Added Quota                     |

## API Key Rules

The Ultra Swap API requires an API key to be used and can be generated via [Portal](https://portal.jup.ag).

* It is required to be used for the Dynamic Rate Limit.
* The API Key is free to generate and is universal, the API Key will work for all APIs.
* Upgrading to a Pro plan only applies to other APIs, does not work with Ultra Swap API.

<Card title="Read about Portal Rate Limits for full details" href="/portal/rate-limit" icon="book-open" horizontal />

## How Dynamic Rate Limit Works

Every **10 minutes**

* The system aggregates your swap volume from `/execute` on Ultra Swap for **the current rolling day** (volume of (current timestamp - 1 day) up to present).
* After which, the Added Quota will update, which will be added on top of the Base Quota.

| Swap Volume | Requests Per Period       | Sliding Window Period |
| :---------- | :------------------------ | :-------------------- |
| \$0         | 50 Base + 0 Added = 50    | 10 seconds            |
| \$10,000    | 50 Base + 1 Added = 51    | 10 seconds            |
| \$100,000   | 50 Base + 11 Added = 61   | 10 seconds            |
| \$1,000,000 | 50 Base + 115 Added = 165 | 10 seconds            |

<Warning>
  The formula is subject to changes as we experiment with the Dynamic Rate Limit system.

  If you find that the rate limit is too restrictive, please reach out to us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/jup).
</Warning>

## Managing Rate Limits

If you receive a 429 response, you should:

1. Implement exponential backoff in your retry logic
2. Wait for sliding window to allow for more requests
3. **Scale your Ultra Swap usage** to unlock higher limits or reach out to us in [Discord](https://discord.gg/jup).

<Warning>
  Bursting beyond your allocation may result in **temporary 429s/rate limits**, even after the refill period. Avoid aggressive retry patterns.
</Warning>

| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Default fees**    | 5 to 10 bps of the swap amount                                             |
| **Integrator fees** | Ultra takes 20% of your integrator fees                                    |
| **Token support**   | SPL and Token2022 tokens                                                   |
| **Fee mint**        | Fee mint is determined by Ultra based on a [priority list](#priority-list) |

### Fees Overview

| Token Type                                                       | Fee (bps) |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Buying Jupiter-related tokens:<br />SOL/Stable -> JUP/JLP/jupSOL | 0         |
| Pegged Assets (LST-LST, Stable-Stable)                           | 0         |
| SOL-Stable                                                       | 2         |

| New Tokens (within 24 hours token age)                           | 50        |

### Priority List

When requesting for an order, Ultra will decide which mint to take fees in based on a priority list. The list consists of different categories of tokens.

1. SOL - Solana!
2. Stablecoins - USDC, USDT, etc
3. Liquid Staked Tokens (LSTs) - JupSOL, etc
4. Bluechips - Typically large market cap tokens
5. Others - Other tokens that do not fall into the above categories

<Note>
  You can use the `/order` endpoint to check for the `feeMint` and `feeBps` field directly.

  Or you can use the `/fees` endpoint to check the fees and category given the input and output mint.

  ```bash  theme={null}
  curl -X GET 'https://api.jup.ag/ultra/v1/fees?inputMint=EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v&outputMint=So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112' \
    -H 'x-api-key: your-api-key'
  ```
</Note>

### Integrator Fees

To add integrator fees to Ultra Swaps, you will be required to set up referral accounts and token accounts for the specific token mints you want to collect fees in.

Refer to the [Add Integrator Fees](/docs/ultra/add-fees-to-ultra) guide for more details on how to set up.

# About Metis Swap API

> Overview of the Metis Swap API and its features.

Metis is Jupiter's original, low-level routing engine designed for maximum flexibility, transparency, and composability. It was the foundation that set the standard for reliable, general-purpose liquidity aggregation on Solana, and its learnings directly informed the development of newer engines like Iris (which powers Jupiter Ultra).

Unlike Jupiter Ultra and its routing engines (Juno, Iris, JupiterZ), which focus on end-to-end execution and abstraction, Metis exposes granular control over raw swap instructions. This is beneficial for developers and integrators who need to fine-tune every aspect of their swap transactions.

<Card href="/docs/routing" icon="book-open" horizontal>
  Learn more about how Metis fits into Jupiter's routing ecosystem, including Juno, Iris, and JupiterZ, in our [Routing documentation](/docs/routing).

<Card href="/blog/metis-v7" icon="book-open" horizontal>
  Metis is now an independent public good, no longer coupled to Jupiter or Ultra, and is maintained as a toolkit for the ecosystem. Read more in our [Metis v7 blog post](/blog/metis-v7).

  Though Jupiter continues to provide access to a hosted Metis API for developers.
</Card>

## We recommend using Ultra Swap API

Ultra Swap API is the spiritual successor to Metis Swap API, and is much simpler to use than Metis Swap API. If you are first starting out on your Solana development journey, using Ultra Swap API is highly recommended over Metis Swap API.

<Tip>
  For more information about Ultra Swap API, please refer to the [Ultra Swap API](/docs/ultra) documentation.

# Add Fees To Swap

> Walkthrough on how to add fees to the Metis Swap API.

<Note>
  **INFO**

  As of January 2025, when integrating the Metis Swap API, you no longer need to use the Referral Program to set up a `referralAccount` and `referralTokenAccount` to collect fees from the swaps you provide to the end users.

  Simply, just pass in any valid token account as the `feeAccount` parameter in the Metis Swap API.

  However, do note that **it is still applicable to the Trigger API**.
</Note>

<Info>
  **NOTE**

  You can still find information about the Referral Program.

  The Referral Program is an open source program by Jupiter to provide referral fees for integrators who are integrating Jupiter Swap and Jupiter Limit Order. You can check out the code [here](https://github.com/TeamRaccoons/referral) to gain a better understanding of how it works.
</Info>

## Overview

By default, there are **zero** protocol fees on Jupiter Swap. Integrators have the option to introduce a platform fee denoted in basis points, e.g. **20 bps** for **0.2%** of the token input or output.

### Important Notes

* For ExactIn swaps, the `feeAccount`'s mint can be either the **input mint or output mint** of the swap pair, and not any other mints.
* For ExactOut swaps, the `feeAccount`'s mint can only be the **input mint** of the swap pair.
* Example, if you swap JUP to USDC, you cannot take fees in SOL, it has to be part of the swap pair.
* It supports SPL and Token2022 tokens.
  * [Refer to this update for support of Token2022 tokens](/updates#jupiter-aggregator-v6-program-update).
* Referral Program is no longer required for Metis Swap API.

### 1. Set up

You will need to complete the prerequisites and understanding of [Environment Setup](/get-started/environment-setup) and [Get Quote and Swap](/docs/swap/get-quote) guide as this is reliant on the Metis Swap API.

### 2. Set your fee in Quote

Setting your fee is simple, just add `platformFeeBps` parameter to the `/quote` endpoint.

In this example, we set `platformFeeBps` to `20` which equates to 0.2%.

```js  theme={null}
const quoteResponse = await (
    await fetch(
        'https://api.jup.ag/swap/v1/quote?' +
        'inputMint=So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112&' +
        'outputMint=EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v&' +
        'amount=100000&' +
        'slippageBps=50&' +
        'restrictIntermediateTokens=true&' +
        'platformFeeBps=20&' +
        'instructionVersion=V2' // required if you want to collect fees in Token2022 tokens
    ),
    {
        headers: {
            'x-api-key': 'your-api-key',
        },
    }
  ).json();
```

### 3. Set your feeAccount in Swap

In the `/swap` endpoint, you will need to pass in the `feeAccount` parameter.

* The `feeAccount` is a token account that will receive the fees from the swap - the mint of the token account has to be part of the swap pair.
* Do ensure that the token account needs to be initialized beforehand and is the correct mint to receive the fees in.
* For ExactIn swaps, the `feeAccount`'s mint can be either the **input mint or output mint** of the swap pair, and not any other mints.
* For ExactOut swaps, the `feeAccount`'s mint can only be the **input mint** of the swap pair.
* Example, if you swap JUP to USDC, you cannot take fees in SOL, it has to be part of the swap pair.
* Refer to the [Create Token Account](#create-token-account) section to create a token account.

```js  theme={null}
const swapResponse = await (
    await fetch('https://api.jup.ag/swap/v1/swap', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'x-api-key': 'your-api-key',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            quoteResponse,
            userPublicKey: wallet.publicKey, // Pass in actual referred user in production
            feeAccount: feeAccount, // feeAccount is the token account that will receive the fees
        }),
    })
).json();
```

### 4. Sign and send transaction

Finally, the user can sign the transaction and it can be submitted to the network to be executed. You can refer to the [Send Swap Transaction](/docs/swap/send-swap-transaction) guide to complete this step.

### Create Token Account

To create a token account, you can use the following code or refer to [Solana Cookbook](https://solana.com/developers/cookbook/tokens/create-token-account).

* The code creates the transaction to create the token account and handles the transaction siging and sending.
* If the token account already exists, it will not create and might throw an error such as `Provided owner is not allowed`.

```js  theme={null}
import { createAssociatedTokenAccount } from "@solana/spl-token";

const mintPubkey = new PublicKey(
    "JUPyiwrYJFskUPiHa7hkeR8VUtAeFoSYbKedZNsDvCN",
);

let ata = await createAssociatedTokenAccount(
    connection, // connection
    wallet, // fee payer
    mintPubkey, // mint
    wallet.publicKey, // owner of the token account
    // confirmOptions, // if you need to skip simulation and send the transaction immediately
    // programId, // if you need to use a different token program id such as token-2022
    // associatedTokenProgramId,
    // allowOwnerOffCurve, // if you need to allow the owner to be off curve
);
console.log(`ATA: ${ata.toBase58()}`);
```

## For Trigger API Integrator Fee

**Important Notes**

* The Jupiter Swap project account for the Referral Program is `45ruCyfdRkWpRNGEqWzjCiXRHkZs8WXCLQ67Pnpye7Hp`.

* The `referralTokenAccount` can either be:

  * **Input mint or the output mint** on the swap for ExactIn.
  * **Input mint ONLY** on the swap for ExactOut.

* You can use the [Dashboard](https://referral.jup.ag/dashboard), [SDK](https://github.com/TeamRaccoons/referral/blob/main/example/src/createReferralAccount.ts) or [API](https://referral.jup.ag/api) to set up the `referralAccount` and `referralTokenAccount` in this guide.

**1. Set up**

**Obtain `referralAccount` and `referralTokenAccount`**

There are 2 ways you can set up a referral account.

1. Use our [referral dashboard](https://referral.jup.ag/dashboard) to create them. After creating, remember to find your `Referral Key` on the page and the associated token accounts.
2. Use our SDK to create them. You can use the [example scripts](https://github.com/TeamRaccoons/referral/tree/main/example/src) to create.

**Obtain `mintAccount`**

As for the mint account, assuming you have an interface where a user swaps, you will know up front what are the input or output mints. For the sake of example, we will use a hardcoded mint public key.

```js  theme={null}
const referralAccount = new Publickey('ReplaceWithPubkey');
const mintAccount = new Publickey('So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112');
```

**2. Get your referral token account for `feeAccount`**

In order to refer and receive fees from all types of tokens, you will need to have already initialize `referralTokenAccount`s (owned by your `referralAccount`) for the mint in the order.

In this code block, we will be using the SDK to try to find the `referralTokenAccount` based on our previously defined `referralAccount` and `mintAccount`. If the token account is not found, it will send a transaction to the network to attempt to initialize one for the mint.

```js  theme={null}
import { ReferralProvider } from "@jup-ag/referral-sdk";

const { tx, referralTokenAccountPubKey } = await provider.initializeReferralTokenAccount({
    payerPubKey: wallet.publicKey,
    referralAccountPubKey: referralAccount,
    mint: mintAccount,
});

const referralTokenAccount = await connection.getAccountInfo(referralTokenAccountPubKey);

// Attempt to initialize a token account
if (!referralTokenAccount) {
    const signature = await sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, tx, [wallet]);
    console.log({ signature, referralTokenAccountPubKey: referralTokenAccountPubKey.toBase58() });

// Since initialized, it will carry on
} else {
    console.log(`referralTokenAccount ${referralTokenAccountPubKey.toBase58()} for mint ${mintAccount.toBase58()} already exists`);
};

const feeAccount = referralTokenAccountPubKey;
console.log(feeAccount);
```

If you are confident that the `referralTokenAccount` for specific mints have been created, you can use this method to get it. **Do note that, even if the token account is not intialized, it will still return a pubkey as it is a Program Derived Address and is deterministic. [Read more here.](https://solana.com/docs/core/pda#findprogramaddress)**

```js  theme={null}
const [feeAccount] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(
    [
        Buffer.from("referral_ata"), // A string that signifies the account type, here "referral_ata."
        referralAccount.toBuffer(), //  The public key of the referral account converted into a buffer.
        mintAccount.toBuffer(), // The mint public key, converted into a buffer.
    ],
    new PublicKey("REFER4ZgmyYx9c6He5XfaTMiGfdLwRnkV4RPp9t9iF3") // The public key of the Referral Program
);
```

**3. Set your `feeAccount` and `params.feeBps`**

Setting your referral fee is simple, just add `feeAccount` and `params.feeBps` parameters to the `/createOrder` endpoint.

In this example, we set `params.feeBps` to `20` which equates to 0.2%.

```js  theme={null}
const createOrderResponse = await (
    await fetch('https://api.jup.ag/trigger/v1/createOrder', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'x-api-key': 'your-api-key',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            inputMint: inputMint.toString(),
            outputMint: outputMint.toString(),
            maker: "jdocuPgEAjMfihABsPgKEvYtsmMzjUHeq9LX4Hvs7f3",
            payer: "jdocuPgEAjMfihABsPgKEvYtsmMzjUHeq9LX4Hvs7f3",
            params: {
                makingAmount: "1000000",
                takingAmount: "300000",
                // slippageBps: "", // Optional, by nature, trigger orders execute with 0 slippage
                // expiredAt: "", // In unix seconds (e.g. Date.now()/1_000) or optional
                feeBps: "20", // feeBps is the amount of fees in bps that will be sent to the fee account
            },
            computeUnitPrice: "auto",
            feeAccount, // feeAccount is the token account that will receive the fees
            // wrapAndUnwrapSol: true, // Default true or optional
        })
    })
).json();
```

# Add Fees To Swap

> Walkthrough on how to add fees to the Metis Swap API.

<Note>
  **INFO**

  As of January 2025, when integrating the Metis Swap API, you no longer need to use the Referral Program to set up a `referralAccount` and `referralTokenAccount` to collect fees from the swaps you provide to the end users.

  Simply, just pass in any valid token account as the `feeAccount` parameter in the Metis Swap API.

  However, do note that **it is still applicable to the Trigger API**.
</Note>

<Info>
  **NOTE**

  You can still find information about the Referral Program.

  The Referral Program is an open source program by Jupiter to provide referral fees for integrators who are integrating Jupiter Swap and Jupiter Limit Order. You can check out the code [here](https://github.com/TeamRaccoons/referral) to gain a better understanding of how it works.
</Info>

## Overview

By default, there are **zero** protocol fees on Jupiter Swap. Integrators have the option to introduce a platform fee denoted in basis points, e.g. **20 bps** for **0.2%** of the token input or output.

### Important Notes

* For ExactIn swaps, the `feeAccount`'s mint can be either the **input mint or output mint** of the swap pair, and not any other mints.
* For ExactOut swaps, the `feeAccount`'s mint can only be the **input mint** of the swap pair.
* Example, if you swap JUP to USDC, you cannot take fees in SOL, it has to be part of the swap pair.
* It supports SPL and Token2022 tokens.
  * [Refer to this update for support of Token2022 tokens](/updates#jupiter-aggregator-v6-program-update).
* Referral Program is no longer required for Metis Swap API.

### 1. Set up

You will need to complete the prerequisites and understanding of [Environment Setup](/get-started/environment-setup) and [Get Quote and Swap](/docs/swap/get-quote) guide as this is reliant on the Metis Swap API.

### 2. Set your fee in Quote

Setting your fee is simple, just add `platformFeeBps` parameter to the `/quote` endpoint.

In this example, we set `platformFeeBps` to `20` which equates to 0.2%.

```js  theme={null}
const quoteResponse = await (
    await fetch(
        'https://api.jup.ag/swap/v1/quote?' +
        'inputMint=So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112&' +
        'outputMint=EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v&' +
        'amount=100000&' +
        'slippageBps=50&' +
        'restrictIntermediateTokens=true&' +
        'platformFeeBps=20&' +
        'instructionVersion=V2' // required if you want to collect fees in Token2022 tokens
    ),
    {
        headers: {
            'x-api-key': 'your-api-key',
        },
    }
  ).json();
```

### 3. Set your feeAccount in Swap

In the `/swap` endpoint, you will need to pass in the `feeAccount` parameter.

* The `feeAccount` is a token account that will receive the fees from the swap - the mint of the token account has to be part of the swap pair.

* For ExactOut swaps, the `feeAccount`'s mint can only be the **input mint** of the swap pair.
* Example, if you swap JUP to USDC, you cannot take fees in SOL, it has to be part of the swap pair.
* Refer to the [Create Token Account](#create-token-account) section to create a token account.

```js  theme={null}
const swapResponse = await (
    await fetch('https://api.jup.ag/swap/v1/swap', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'x-api-key': 'your-api-key',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            quoteResponse,
            userPublicKey: wallet.publicKey, // Pass in actual referred user in production
            feeAccount: feeAccount, // feeAccount is the token account that will receive the fees
        }),
    })
).json();
